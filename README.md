# Animal Shelter Analysis Project - Bloomington Animal Shelter Data

Animal shelters have many challenges facing them in their quest to unite abandoned animals with good homes. 

Team Pontaic, featuring data science students Sarah Schluter and Ardita Musovic, are both animal lovers and concered about the state of animal shelters across the United States. We have chosen to analyze animal shelter data from the Bloomington Animal Shelter as a way to understand the mechanisms that bring animals in shelters and also to demonstrate the culmination of skills learned.

This Final Project will utilize all the information and skills we have been learning from Entity Academy and Woz-U.

This is the data set used for animal shelters data in this project: [City of Bloomington Open Data â€“ Bloomington Animal Shelter](https://bloomington.data.socrata.com/dataset/Animal-Shelter-Animals/e245-r9ub)
